# delegate (C# Reference)

The declaration of a delegate type is similar to a method signature. It has a return value and any number of parameters of any type:

```csharp
public delegate void TestDelegate(string message);
public delegate int TestDelegate(MyType m, long num);
```

A `delegate` is a reference type that can be used to encapsulate a named or an anonymous method. Delegates are similar to function pointers in C++; however, delegates are type-safe and secure. For applications of delegates, see [Delegates](../../../csharp/programming-guide/delegates/index.md) and [Generic Delegates](../../../csharp/programming-guide/generics/generic-delegates.md).

## Remarks

Delegates are the basis for [Events](../../../csharp/programming-guide/events/index.md).

A delegate can be instantiated by associating it either with a named or anonymous method. For more information, see [Named Methods](../../../csharp/programming-guide/delegates/delegates-with-named-vs-anonymous-methods.md) and [Anonymous Methods](../../../csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/anonymous-methods.md).

The delegate must be instantiated with a method or lambda expression that has a compatible return type and input parameters. For more information on the degree of variance that is allowed in the method signature, see [Variance in Delegates](../../programming-guide/concepts/covariance-contravariance/using-variance-in-delegates.md). For use with anonymous methods, the delegate and the code to be associated with it are declared together. Both ways of instantiating delegates are discussed in this section.
